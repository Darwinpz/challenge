/**
 * Input Port (Use Case Interface) - Create Customer
 * <p>
 * HEXAGONAL ARCHITECTURE - PRIMARY PORT:
 * This interface defines the contract for creating a customer.
 * It is independent of any framework or infrastructure.
 * <p>
 * SOLID PRINCIPLES APPLIED:
 * - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Single, focused interface
 * - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level policy (domain) doesn't depend on low-level details
 * <p>
 * DESIGN PATTERNS APPLIED:
 * - Port/Adapter Pattern: This is a PRIMARY PORT (input) in hexagonal architecture
 * - Command Pattern: Represents a command to create a customer
