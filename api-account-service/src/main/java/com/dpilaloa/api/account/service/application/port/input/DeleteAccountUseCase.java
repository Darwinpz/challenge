/**
 * APPLICATION PORT (INPUT): DeleteAccountUseCase
 * <p>
 * DESIGN PATTERNS APPLIED:
 * - Port Pattern (Hexagonal Architecture): Interface defining business capability
 * - Command Pattern: Represents a command to delete an account
 * - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Specific interface for one use case
 * <p>
 * SOLID PRINCIPLES:
 * - Interface Segregation: Clients depend only on delete operation
 * - Dependency Inversion: Domain depends on abstraction, not concrete implementation
 * - Single Responsibility: Only defines account deletion contract
 * <p>
 * IMPLEMENTATION:
 * - Implemented by AccountService in application layer
 * - Called by REST controllers (primary adapters)
 * <p>
 * DELETE STRATEGIES:
 * - SOFT DELETE (PATCH /accounts/{id} with state=false): Account.state = false
 * - HARD DELETE (DELETE /accounts/{id}): Permanently remove account
 * <p>
 * BUSINESS RULES:
 * - Account must exist
 * - Cascade delete movements if hard delete
 * - Publish account.deleted. event to Kafka
 *
