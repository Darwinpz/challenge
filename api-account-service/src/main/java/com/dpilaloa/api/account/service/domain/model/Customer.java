/**
 * DOMAIN MODEL: Customer (Value Object)
 * <p>
 * Represents customer data from Customer Service.
 * This is a Value Object in Domain-Driven Design (DDD).
 * <p>
 * DESIGN PATTERNS APPLIED:
 * - Value Object Pattern (DDD): Immutable representation of customer data
 * - DTO Pattern: Data transfer from external service
 * <p>
 * SOLID PRINCIPLES:
 * - Single Responsibility: Only stores customer data
 * - Dependency Inversion: Depends on abstraction (Customer exists in another service)
 * <p>
 * PURPOSE:
 * - Data transfer from Customer Service via WebClient
 * - Data transfer from Kafka events (banking.customer.events)
 * - Validation of customer state for business rules
 * <p>
 * DATA SOURCE:
 * - WebClient call to Customer Service (validation)
 * - Kafka events (CUSTOMER_CREATED, CUSTOMER_UPDATED, CUSTOMER_DELETED)
 * <p>
 * NOTE: This is NOT a database entity - it's a pure domain model
 * <p>
