/**
 * APPLICATION PORT (OUTPUT): EventPublisher
 * <p>
 * DESIGN PATTERNS APPLIED:
 * - Port Pattern (Hexagonal Architecture): Interface defining infrastructure capability
 * - Publisher Pattern: Abstract event publishing layer
 * - Observer Pattern: Event-driven communication
 * - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Domain defines contract, infrastructure implements
 * <p>
 * SOLID PRINCIPLES:
 * - Dependency Inversion: High-level domain doesn't depend on low-level Kafka
 * - Interface Segregation: Specific interface for event publishing
 * - Single Responsibility: Only defines event publishing contract
 * - Open/Closed: Open for new event types, closed for modification
 * <p>
 * IMPLEMENTATION:
 * - Implemented by KafkaEventPublisher in infrastructure layer
 * - Uses Reactor Kafka for reactive event publishing
 * <p>
 * KAFKA TOPICS:
 * - banking.account.events (for account CRUD events)
 * - banking.movement.events (for movement events)
 * <p>
 * EVENT HEADERS:
 * - correlation-id: For distributed tracing
 * - event-type: Type of event (ACCOUNT_CREATED, etc.)
 * - timestamp: Event timestamp
 * <p>
