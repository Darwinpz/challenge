/**
 * APPLICATION PORT (INPUT): CreateAccountUseCase
 * DESIGN PATTERNS APPLIED:
 * - Port Pattern (Hexagonal Architecture): Interface defining business capability
 * - Command Pattern: Represents a command to create an account
 * - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Specific interface for one use case
 * <p>
 * SOLID PRINCIPLES:
 * - Interface Segregation: Clients depend only on create operation
 * - Dependency Inversion: Domain depends on abstraction, not concrete implementation
 * - Single Responsibility: Only defines account creation contract
 * <p>
 * IMPLEMENTATION:
 * - Implemented by AccountService in application layer
 * - Called by REST controllers (primary adapters)
 * <p>
 * BUSINESS RULES ENFORCED:
 * - Customer must exist and be active
 * - Initial balance must be >= 0
 * - Account type must be valid (AHORRO or CORRIENTE)
 * <p>
